# ResQ Paws – Mini Project

## About the Project

ResQ Paws is an initiative dedicated to helping injured and abandoned dogs through rescue, treatment, and rehabilitation.

The project was inspired by the story of **Bheema**, a brave Golden Retriever whose journey sparked a movement of care, compassion, and responsibility toward animals in need.


ResQ Paws is a mini project developed as part of weekly academic assignments.  
The project demonstrates frontend, backend, database, React, and deployment concepts learned during the course.
